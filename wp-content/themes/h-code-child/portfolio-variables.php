<p>Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.</p>
<p>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that Iâ€™m more honest and my words are more beautiful. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote those Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.</p>";
